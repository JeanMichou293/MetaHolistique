Verifier
	Goal: makes sure solution is valid
		verify every machine is not used for multiple operations at the same time
		verify order of operations is respected
		verify operations within job are not overlapping
Determine complexity of solver
"Optimizer"
	getShiftCombinations(Solution solution)
	main func: while (solution is better than previous) { atomic shift; process every job except the shifted one; ...}
Scheduler
	Ideas of optimisation
		#1. Distribute priority: first time, J0 then J1 etc. ; second time, J1 then J2 etc. ; etc.
		#2. Shortest total remaining operations first

	

Implement MA and OS (cf. Marie Jo's homepage), determine the overall project cost
Timeline: models time constraint (one operation by machine at a time)
	=> used for generating MA and OS
