"Optimiser"
	Improve it (shifting every time the longest job is kinda stupid)
		#1. Random shift on (random) job
Test Optimiser with every version of the scheduler
	Compare CPU time

EXTRA MVP
Organise sources into folders
	E.g. util, model, tools, etc.
Display
	Display very basic Gantt (use one "\t" or shit by time unit)
Genericity
	No integers (=> pass type as a parameter (<T>))
