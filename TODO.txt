"Optimiser"
	Improve it (shifting every time the longest job is kinda stupid)
		#1. Random shift on (random) job
Test Optimiser with every version of the scheduler
	Compare CPU time

EXTRA MVP
Solver
	Move Project.process() && Project.solve() to Solver
	!!! If you need to access private fields of Project, pass "solver()" to Project (cf. comparators and "public int compare{}" (anonymous class))
Organise sources into folders
	E.g. util, model, tools, etc.
Display
	Display very basic Gantt (use one "\t" or shit by time unit)
Genericity
	No integers (=> pass type as a parameter (<T>))
